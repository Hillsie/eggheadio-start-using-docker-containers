# 06 - Deploy a Docker project with Zeit's Now

- Zeit's Now can be used not only for deploying Node apps, but using Docker any
    environment with any app can be deployed with a few lines of code.
- Each time `now` is executed from the terminal the app is deployed, and
    deployed to the same URL.
